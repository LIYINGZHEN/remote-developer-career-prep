## Q. My Job Criteria

- [ ] 1. Allows you to learn and grow
- [ ] 2. Allows you to grow remotely (this will open a lot of doors to higher salaries later)
- [ ] 3. Allows you to work in English
- [ ] 4. Pays more than $3,000/month. I think you should aim for $3200-$3,400 at least then.

### Q: If it’s a true remote company. I don't have to go there right?

A: Even the best remote companies in the world will want you to spend time face to face. I'm not saying they are a leading remote company. I think they still have to build a team for starters, but still... spending face to face time is a luxury that you shouldn't reject if you can
Many remote companies even want you to move where your manager or mentor is at least for a few weeks so you can get up to speed, and then you go back to wherever you want and work remotely from there.

### Q: How often I have go there is fine?

A: Going there for 1-2 weeks yes, going there for a week every month or every other month is ok too, but not working remotely not.

### Q: Should I give a number when asked for a salary?

No. When asked for a salary, never give a number

Ex.

I would appreciate it if you could make me an offer on what you have budgeted for this role. I'm looking for a remote position so my salary is not tied to local salaries in Taiwan (just to give you a reference, I was making $1,600/month 2 years ago), but I’m sure the salary you have in mind is consistent with the rest of the remote market. What's the salary range being offered?

Ex.

It's totally fine for me going there for a couple of weeks to get to know the team and the product.

But it will be much more comfortable for me if you could agree on a salary first that I can't take a salary that is lower than what I was making a few years ago.

After I spend a few weeks in Cambodia, if you are not happy with me, you can just pay me for those weeks and that's it.
