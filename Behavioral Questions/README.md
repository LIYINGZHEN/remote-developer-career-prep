# Task #3

### 1. What are your weaknesses?

1. Sometimes, I will take action quickly and I don't have a very good attention to detail. While that's good because it lets me execute quickly, it also means that I sometimes make careless mistakes. Because of that, I make sure to always have someone else double check my work.

2. weakness: lack of practice in other major frontend frameworks e.g. Vue & Angular.
   remedy: side projects in these upcoming frontend frameworks, to keep abreast with new technologies.

Example:

```
TypeScript is very popular and used in a lot of aspects in current software development; however, in my development shop, I only work on JavaScript and hardly have a chance to work on static typing languages or TypeScript skills. So I have started a small TypeScript project using React.js to work on this skill that I lack.
```

3. weakness: get frustrated when i am blocked.
   remedy: I mark blocked tasks in my task tracker & seek help from peers and senior engineers as soon as I get an oppotunity. So that i can take on more tasks and keep the momentum.

### 2. Tell me about yourself

#### Example 2: Max

Current Role [Headline Only):
"I'm a freelancer at Upwork, where I've been building projects for clients for several months.'

College:
My background is in aerospace engineering. I did my undergrad at NUKU and spent a few summers working at startups.

Post College & Onwards:
After college, I wanted to get some exposure to larger corporations so I joined Amazon as a developer. It was a great experience. I learned a ton about large system design and I got to really drive the launch of a key part of AWS. That actually showed me that I really wanted to be in a more entrepreneurial environment.

Current Role [Details]:
One of myoid managers from Amazon recruited me out to join her startup, which was what brought me to Microworks. Here, I did the initial system architecture, which has scaled pretty well with our rapid growth. I then took an opportunity to lead the Android team. I do manage a team of three, but my role is primarily with technical leadership: architecture, coding, etc.

Outside of Work:
Outside of work, I've been participating in some hackathons-mostly doing iOS development there as a way to learn it more deeply. I'm also active as a moderator on online forums around Android development.

Wrap Up:
I'm looking now for something new, and your company caught my eye. I've always loved the connection with the user, and I really want to get back to a smaller environment too.

#### Example 2: Kevin

Current Role [Headline Only]:
I’m a software engineer at TaliCraft, where i've been leading the Web development & Android teams for 3 years.

College:
My background is computer science. I did my undergrad at JKUAT and spent two years working at a startup.

Post College & Onwards:
After college, I wanted to get some exposure to larger corporations so I joined Davis & Shirtliff as a developer. It was a great experience. I learned a ton about large system design and I got to really drive the launch of a key part of E-Spares Cloud, an online catalog for spare part management in the company. That actually showed me that I really wanted to be in a more entrepreneurial environment.

Current Role [Detail]:
After 2 years of work at a startup, I noticed that there was a demand for full-stack engineers in my area(Nairobi), so I started doing freelance projects full time, and eventually this grew into a consultancy. I've built multiple mobile and web applications for companies and helped them deploy and test with their users.

Outside of Work:
As a hobby, I build 'fun' apps such as an Android app that can detect cat faces in a video stream using OpenCV.
I'm also a coach in Rails for a local developer group, Rails Girls Nairobi.

Wrap Up:
I'm looking now for something new, and your company caught my eye.

### 3. Why do you want to work for X company?

Well, I have great respect for your company’s software products and I would welcome the opportunity to work with the best in the business. At the same time, I have friends in the industry who have told me about your company’s respect for employees and how you create a great environment for rewarding innovation. I think my proactive style would fit in really well here — especially in this particular role.

### 4. Why do you want to leave your current/last company?

1. I have been doing freelancing works for a while and have learned a lot from working with some amazing client. I have learn how to clarity features and develver projects on time. However, I am starting to feel like I need some new challenges.

2. It's been a fantastic experience, but I feel that I've learned everything I can in my current position. I can't see any place to advance within the organization, and I love to be challenged, so I think it's a good time to move on.

3. I love my job but I haven't had the opportunity to use my programming/rendering/analytical skills there as much as I'd like to, so I think working here could be a better fit for me.

### 5. What are you looking for in your next role?

1. To sum it up, I’d love a position where I can use my skills to make an impact that I can see with my own eyes. Of course, the position is only part of the equation. Being at a company where I can grow and work toward something I care about matters, too. <Company>’s goal of <description> inspires me, and I’m really excited about this opportunity.

2. I am excited by the opportunity to work with an innovative, successful company such as your own. I look forward to utilizing the experience I have in technology to help streamline a company’s products for even more successful implementation.

3. I look forward to working for a company whose mission I firmly believe in, such as your own. I look for jobs about which I am passionate because this allows me to be extremely productive and creative.

4. I’ve been honing my [insert useful skill] skills for a few years now and, first and foremost, I’m looking for a position where I can continue to exercise those skills.

### 6. Tell me about a time when you had a conflict with a co-worker.

1. Once, a co-worker and I disagreed on the way an unsatisfied customer was dealt with. I decided to meet with them one on one to talk and resolve our dispute in a peaceful manner. We both agreed that our goal was to keep the customer happy and came to a compromise that consisted of both of our ideas.

2. Yes, I've worked with someone whom I found difficult to like as a person. However, when I focused on the skills they brought to the job, their ability to solve problems and the two things I did appreciate, slowly my attitude towards them changed. We were never friends, but we did work well together.

### 7. Tell me about a time in which you had a conflict and needed to influence somebody else.

1. Once, I had a problem with my team whereby it took too long to translate designs to front-end code. The front-end developer blamed the designer for taking too long to deliver designs, while the designer said that the deisgns changed far too often to deliver at the speed needed.
   Upon further investigation, I realised that the designer had to export, zip and email designs every time a piece of work was due, and then ater getting feedback, the process would be repeated again.
   Introduced Zeplin to our process flow, and worked with the designer to configure his tools(Photoshop), so that he could export immediately a piece of work was done. I also integrated this with Slack ,so that the developer could get updates in real time.
   This helped the team's turnaround time reduce and thus improve on efficiency of work.

2. Once, I was working on an important feature to our app but one of our managers asked me to fix a small issue for him.

It's not good for developers to switch between tasks and the issue was not that important compared to what I currently working on so I rejected him.

He was very angry and I thought that we needed to figure out a way to solve it. And I figured out that we could use GitHub to manage the priorities. So next time if he needed someone to do a task for him he could create an issue on the Github and assign people who were available.

And the result was really good and we never had the similar conflicts and more.

### 8. What project are you currently working on?

#### Example 1: Max

Right now I'm working on an Airbnb clone project which built with TypeScript, React.js, and GraphQL.

#### Example 2: Kevin

A job application system that allows job-seekers to automatically apply for jobs on popular websites.

### 9. What is the most challenging aspect of your current project?

#### Example 1: Max

The most challenging aspect is that I'm trying new things to build my Airbnb project. Like I use yarn workspace, Formik package, and sharing controllers between web and react-native app.

#### Example 2: Kevin

I'm learning how to work with new tools, such as Puppeteer, to navigate web pages and perform user interactions.

### 10. What was the most difficult bug that you fixed in the past 6 months?

While working with Docker on a project, I had to use 2 services to build an API endpoint. Being new to Docker, I didn't understand how to network multiple containers, and so I kept messing up the IP addresses and couldn't figure out how to make them communicate. It was only when I dug deep into the documentation that I discovered that Docker uses a different Network Addressing system for it containers, and managed to fix this.

### 11. How do you tackle challenges? Name a difficult challenge you faced while working on a project, how you overcame it, and what you learned.

1. When the software development of our new product stalled, I coordinated with my peers which managed to get the schedule back on track. We were able to successfully troubleshoot the issues and solve the problems, within a very short period of time, and without completely burning out our team. I was able to do this by motivating my teammates to brainstorm a technologically innovative solution that would solve the customer’s issues with fewer development hours on our end.

### 12. What are you excited about?

I'm excited about tackling complex projects with teammates. Learn and grow with them and deliver projects which satisfy our customers.

### 13. What frustrates you?

1. I love to work all out on a project and I’m frustrated when my co workers don’t seem to care as much.

2. When someone who works for me or with me lies to me without a reason. I understand when you need to hold the company position and information needs to be withheld, but to lie for no reason makes me lose trust in the person.

### 14. Imagine it is your first day here at the company. What do you want to work on? What features would you improve on?

This may be Subjective -> I'd like to come up with the system design(probably of the systems the company works with), so as to understand the whole picture of the project.

### 15. What are the most interesting projects you have worked on and how might they be relevant to this company's environment?

Subjective as well -> Do research on your interviewer's company and come up with ways in which what you have done relates to them.

### 16. Tell me about a time you had a disagreement with your manager.

I once disagreed with my manager over how to best help a customer. Rather than question his authority in front of everyone, I talked to him off of the floor. I was open and honest about the problems I had with the way he wanted to do things. It turned out that there was just a simple misunderstanding. That disagreement we had showed me the importance of communicating with my coworkers to make sure that something obsolete doesn’t become a bigger problem than it needs to be.

### 17. Talk about a project you are most passionate about, or one where you did your best work.

Guides -> Best in view of the company.
-> Maybe say how the work improved a work process/reduced wastage/increased sales of a tech offering.

#### Example 1: Max

### 18. What does your best day of work look like?

The best day for me is when we successfully deploy a project to production so end users can start interacting with it.

### 19. What is something that you had to push for in your previous projects?

Thoughts --> More of a tooling question than a tech stack preference question.

### 20. What is the most constructive feedback you have received in your career?

As a self-taught programmer. I was always working by myself. My mentor advised me that in order to be a world class developer, I would need to work with diverse teams, in order to understand how professional software development is done.
This has helped me learn how to interact and interface with designers, lead developers, project managers, project owners and end-users, which I feel is a useful skill for a developer, other than coding.

### 21. What is something you had to persevere at for multiple months?

```ts
if(interviewer === 'engineer') {
  mouth.talk_about('A refatoring exercise, where there was insuffecient documentation and changes had to be made for system to continue being used.')
  Outcome -> New and improved system, better documentation, more transparency in the build -> test -> deploy cycle

  mouth.talk_about('Once, when I was refactoring on a project which the previous maintainer had left and there was not much documentation. I spent several months to finished it and in order to prevent this from happing again, I also wrote a documentation so that newcomers can easily understand.')

} elseif(interviewer === 'recruiter') {
  
  mouth.talk_about('Talk about situation that got you out of comfort zone e.g Had to relocate, new place had terrible conditions for working')
  Outcome -> deployed successfully  
}
```
