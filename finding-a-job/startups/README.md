<h1 align="center">Startups</h1>

A category of jobs that requires its dedicated mention is startups. Startups are small companies that work on building innovative products and solve complex problems with very limited resources.

Because of their limited resources, startups often can’t afford to hire developers in their local markets, especially if they are based in expensive cities such as San Francisco or European capitals. Instead, startups are becoming more open to hire remote software developers if that gives them access to more talented developers for a lower price. If you are based in a country with a low cost of living, this is probably a big opportunity for you.

Startups can give you an opportunity to join a global/distributed team and also a place to grow and learn a lot. In exchange, you can give them access to all your skills at a price that might be more competitive for them. Just to give you an idea, startups in San Francisco or Silicon Valley would have to pay at least $90,000 a year to hire an entry-level developer locally. If you can offer the same skills for half or less of the price, it’s likely that they will be willing to accept you as a remote developer.

Most startups would prefer to hire locally, but if you can show them that you can get the job done, chances are that you can convince them to hire you. As you start applying to jobs, we will recommend some resources like AngelList where you can find jobs offered by startups. If this sounds interesting to you, do not hesitate to go all in with this approach. There are thousands of them and they are all eager to find talented and hard-working developers to change the world.
