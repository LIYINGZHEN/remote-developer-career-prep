<h1 align="center">Job Types</h1>

If you haven’t started already, now it’s the time to start applying for jobs. You should be prepared for all kinds of job interviews, and whatever is left to learn, you can learn it from doing actual interviews.

This process won’t be easy. You must accept the fact that not every company will want to hire you. In fact, most companies will say no to you, and sometimes the rejection has nothing to do with you or with something you did or didn’t do. Don’t take rejections personally, but try to ask for feedback and learn from them. Every rejection is practice to do better in the next one.

At this point, you should aim to apply to least 3-5 jobs per day. Focus on applying to new jobs every day and getting more and more experience at job interviews. Before you realize it, you will start receiving job offers.

However, before we get into that, let’s pause a moment to talk about the different types of jobs that you can apply to.

First, let’s start by classifying jobs based on their geographical availability.

## Remote + International

If you don’t live in a developed country and in a major city, chances are that remote and international jobs are the ideal jobs for you. In this type of jobs, you will join a company that has a distributed/remote team with members in multiple locations around the world, and you will be able to work from home or from a coworking space in your city.

This type of jobs will give you access to higher salaries and better learning opportunities. Some of the companies that offer this type of jobs are GitLab, Buffer, Doist, Trello, etc. However, these companies are young and they mostly focus on hiring mid-level and senior developers. They are also small and medium companies, so the number of open positions is small.

Your lack of experience should NOT be a reason to not apply to these companies. Remember that often companies ask for requirements and expectations in the job descriptions that they can be flexible with. If they like you, they might decide to invest in you anyway.

If you like one of these companies, but they don’t currently have an open position, you should still add them to the list of your “Dream jobs” and keep an eye on them so you can be among the first ones to know when there is a position available. We will talk about your “Dream jobs” list a little bit later.

## Remote + Local

If you come across a company in your country or city that is doing something interesting, you might still want to apply to it even if they don’t pay as well as companies from the first category. The reason is that, at this point, what you need is real-world experience. If a local company is building something that you really like, if it has a strong team, and especially if it gives you the opportunity to work remotely, you should consider applying to work with them.

Finding your dream job and building a successful career is like a marathon. No one finds their dream job in the first job they take. However, a local job where you can learn and work remotely will give you the chance to continue growing while getting more experience working remotely. This will, later on, open more doors to jobs from the first category (remote + international) since you will have more experience, both from a technical point of view and also as a remote worker.

## Relocation-based jobs

Not everyone is willing to move to a different city or a different country for a job, but if you are, then your list of potential jobs just grew immensely. Most jobs won’t be close to you, and most companies don’t have remote teams, but if you are willing to move, you can start applying to almost any software job available in the world.

Just keep in mind that there will be immigratory barriers and relocation costs. However, many companies will be willing to take care of all of that if they find the right candidate. Knowing which companies will take care of that is not trivial, but you will start seeing companies who offer that as part of the job description.

If you are willing to relocate, then you should not just look for local and remote jobs, but you should also make a list of the countries you are interested in and start looking on their local job boards.

## Local jobs

Finally, there are local jobs with no remote teams. Unless you live in a developed country and in a major city, your chances and your salary will be limited in this case, but a local and low-pay job is better than no job if you have never worked as a software developer before. Remember that you can always quit that job whenever a better opportunity comes up. We will recommend that you start with the other types of jobs, but you should keep your eyes open for local opportunities too.
