<h1 align="center">Your Dream Job</h1>

## How do you identify your dream jobs?

You should [use this list of 600+ Remote companies](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TLJSlNxCbwRNxy14Toe1PYwbCTY7h0CNHeer9J0VRzE/edit#gid=1279011369) as inspiration. If you really want to get a remote job, take a look at that list and find products and companies that you really like there, then add them to your list of dream jobs.

Remember that you don’t need to find an open position in order to apply to join a company. In fact, 80% of the positions are never posted online!

### Task

Make a copy of this [Google Sheet document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WJ0xaAxjNZXGk1h0twJdTJpezqxyiyoGKb-a8ip07Do/edit#gid=0) and fill it in with the names of at least 10 different dream companies and select if they hire people remotely or not.

## The Ask

As you get to know people in those companies through events and your Twitter activity, you should find some courage to ask them for a coffee or a quick call. You might feel like no one will reply to you, but you will be surprised by how amazing the results can be.

Just send them a direct message on Twitter, or find their email address on their personal page and send them an honest message: Tell them about you, your passion and your current goals, and tell them that you would love to have coffee (if they live in your same city) or do a quick call on Hangouts to hear about their experience working for that company and tips before applying to join. During the call, focus on learning as much as possible from them, try to find opportunities to talk about your work, and ask for feedback.

If you feel like the conversation is going well, do not hesitate to ask if they would be willing to refer you for the position. Companies often offer a referral fee ($$$) to employees who recommend new hires, so they will be often happy to recommend you. If there are currently no open positions, ask them to please let you know if they even hear about a new position opening.

### Task:

Coordinate 3 calls/coffees with employers of your favorite companies. You don’t need to wait to complete this before moving to the next steps, but don’t forget to make this a personal goal. You will have to get out of your comfort zone, but it will be worth it.
