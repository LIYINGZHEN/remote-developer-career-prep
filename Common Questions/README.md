### Q: If itâ€™s a true remote company. I don't have to go there right?

A: Even the best remote companies in the world will want you to spend time face to face. I'm not saying they are a leading remote company. I think they still have to build a team for starters, but still... spending face to face time is a luxury that you shouldn't reject if you can
Many remote companies even want you to move where your manager or mentor is at least for a few weeks so you can get up to speed, and then you go back to wherever you want and work remotely from there.

### Q: How often I have go there is fine?

A: Going there for 1-2 weeks yes, going there for a week every month or every other month is ok too, but not working remotely not.

### Q: How to reject an offer?

Ex.
Sorry, even though the opportunity is interesting, but I am not interested in moving out of Taiwan right now, and I have opportunities with significantly better salaries. I will let you know if my friends who could be interested in the opportunity.

A: Also remember there is a huge difference between entry-level salaries and medium-level ones. Choose a job that will maximize the number of opportunities in the future. And I think that working outside of Taiwan + Remote is the perfect combo.
