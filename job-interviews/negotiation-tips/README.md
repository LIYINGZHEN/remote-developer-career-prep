### Q: Should I give a number when asked for a salary?

No. When asked for a salary, never give a number

Ex.

I would appreciate it if you could make me an offer on what you have budgeted for this role. I'm looking for a remote position so my salary is not tied to local salaries in Taiwan (just to give you a reference, I was making $1,600/month 2 years ago), but Iâ€™m sure the salary you have in mind is consistent with the rest of the remote market. What's the salary range being offered?

Ex.

It's totally fine for me going there for a couple of weeks to get to know the team and the product.

But it will be much more comfortable for me if you could agree on a salary first that I can't take a salary that is lower than what I was making a few years ago.

After I spend a few weeks in Cambodia, if you are not happy with me, you can just pay me for those weeks and that's it.
